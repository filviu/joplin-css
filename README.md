The actual location of the files is ~/.config/joplin-desktop on Linux systems and C:\users\<username>\.config\joplin-desktop on Windows systems. If you have not already opened the css files from within Joplin they initially may not exist in the folder and so will need to be created manually. Do not touch any other files in this folder, they have nothing to do with styling Joplin and could corrupt your Joplin data if tampered with.

It is important to note that these custom stylesheets are loaded as Joplin is started. If you modify either of the stylesheets you have to quit and restart Joplin for the changes to take effect. That is not just closing the Joplin window, it requires Joplin to be Quit (File > Quit or CTRL+Q).
